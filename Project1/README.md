# DS551/CS525 2024 Fall Individual Project 1
# Dynamic Programming of Markov Decision Process

#### Starting Date
* Week 2 Tuesday September 3, 2024(23:59)

#### Due Date
* Week 4 Tuesday September 17, 2024(23:59)

#### Total Points
* 100 (One Hundred)

## Goal

* In this assignment, you will be asked to implement policy iteration and value iteration for the Frozen Lake environment (FrozenLake-v1) from [OpenAI Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/) and play the game with the algorithms you implemented. This project will be completed in Python 3.

* See more details of FrozenLake on [OpenAI Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/).


* If your program works, the command line output should look like this.

## Deliverables

Please compress your mdp_dp.py file into a zipped file (firstName_lastName_hw1.zip) and submit it to Canvas.

## Grading
* policy evaluation (20 points)
* policy improvement (20 points)
* policy iteration (20 points)
* value iteration (20 points)
* rander game (20 points)

## Setup
* Recommended programming IDE (integrated development environment): VS code (See [install VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) 
* Install [Miniconda](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Create virtual environment and install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/): conda create -n myenv python=3.11.4. This will help you create a new conda environment named myenv. Gymnasium library supports for Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 on Linux and macOS.
* Activate your virtual environment: conda activate myenv
* Install gymnasium: pip install "gymnasium[atari]" (See [install gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium))
* Install nose: pip install pynose (See [install nose](https://pypi.org/project/pynose/))
  

```diff
- Note: Our environment code mdp_dp.py and mdp_dp_test.py were developed/updated for the latest version of OpenAI gymnasium (version 0.29.0). 

- So when you install your gym, please use command line pip install "gymnasium[atari]". 
```


## Guidelines
* Implement functions in mdp_dp.py
* Evaluate functions by typing "nosetests -v mdp_dp_test.py" in terminal (you need put mdp_dp.py and mdp_dp_test.py in the same folder)
* If you got error using "nosetests -v mdp_dp_test.py" due to python version (sometimes, nosetests will use python2.7 by default), try: python3 -m nose -v mdp_dp_test.py
